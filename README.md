# track
This Android app was developed as part of the NTU-Garage@EEE LTA-Amazoning Competition 2020. 
It is an app that allows the input of train track inspectors to identify track faults during their normal inspection routine. 
The UI is mainly used to facilitate the interaction with an AWS EC2 instance that has a trained Convolutional Neural Network 
that predicts the presence of track faults. It outputs the results on a webpage hosted on the server built using Flask.
